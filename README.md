See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) for details.

## Recommendations

### Font

- Use a font family including **Medium** weight (e.g. [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto) or [M+](https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp)) to properly display the theme.
- Set the font size to `9.75` (= 13px at 96dpi) or `10.5` (= 14px at 96dpi).

### Chrome Extensions

To improve the appearance of Chrome, you can install the Chrome extensions as follows:

1. Open the `/usr/share/themes/Pocillo<-variant>/chrome` folder in your file manager.
2. Drag and drop the `.crx` files into the Chrome's Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
